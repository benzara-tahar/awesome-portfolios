# Contribution Guidelines

Before submitting a pull request, please make sure that you have read the guidelines and that you have followed them.

- Search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
- Make an individual pull request for each suggestion.
- New categories, or improvements to the existing categorization are welcome.
- Check your spelling and grammar.

Please make sure the portfolio you are submitting adhere to as many of the following guidelines as possible:

- good color contrast, don't cause eye bleeding to read the content
- readable typography, not too small text
- responsive design
- dark theme, or at least a dark/light theme switch
- minimalistic design
- not bloated with too many animation effects, lot of sites causes me dizziness
- SEO friendly, some websites are built entirely using canvas animation, no way to select/index text content
- easy navigation, I avoided some game-like portfolio websites since I found them too distracting and defeating the purpose of delivering the information in a short and efficient way.

Thank you for contributing
